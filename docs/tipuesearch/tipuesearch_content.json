Users with other roles will only see projects and tasks they are involved with, with limited view and edit capabilities. The first time you login, the dashboard will look a bit empty. Don't worry, this will change soon! You will probably notice that the time at the top of the page is incorrect.

The public directory contains all files of the script. The updates directory contains updates for the script. Read more about how to update the script. Upload files Upload all files in the public directory to the root of your website. Not the public directory itself, but the files in it so the structure on your web root looks like this: \\---my-web-root | .editorconfig | .env.example | .gitattributes | .gitignore | .htaccess | artisan | composer.json | composer.lock | package-lock.json | package.json | phpunit.xml | readme.md | server.php | webpack.mix.js | +---app +---bootstrap +---config +---database +---public +---resources +---routes +---storage +---tests \\---vendor Start installation Domain Now you can open the url where you have uploaded the script. You should see a screen like below. Enter the name you want to use, and the domain where you are installing the script. Database Enter the MySQL details. Make sure you use an empty database so there are no conflicting table names. Email Enter the name and email address which will be used by the system to send emails to users. If you want to use SMTP or Mailgun, you can open the .env file in the web root after the installation is completed. Business Enter the name of your company, and optionally an email address and phone number. Login Enter the admin name, and the email address and password you will use to log in. Optionally you can enter a phone number. Click Install and the installation will begin. Be patient, it may take a few minutes. When the installation is finished, you will be redirected to the login screen. You can now log in with the login details you entered earlier. Configure Cron With Cron jobs you can schedule scripts to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. For example, to send a notification when a due date is approaching. Currently the script does not use Cron jobs, but this may change in the future. If you want to set up Crons you can do by logging into your server with SSH and enter the command: crontab -e A text editor will open, and at the bottom you can put this line (make sure to update the correct path to match your installation root): * * * * * php \/srv\/wwwroot\/artisan schedule:run &gt;&gt; \/dev\/null 2&gt;&amp;1 For more information take a look at the Laravel Task Scheduling documentation.

This takes up a considerable part of our time, and therefore also of the product development. Refactoring To avoid technical debt and to improve the general quality of the project, we will refactor code from time to time. On the radar This may change frequently, and there is no guarantee that items on this list will be implemented.

Log in with an Admin user and go to Settings &gt; Update. What kind of support is included? We are happy to help you with technical questions about features. If things don't work as expected, or if you run into any bugs, please let us know and we will try to solve the issue as soon as possible. Support does NOT include the following: We cannot provide general webhosting and\/or general PHP support. We cannot provide general Laravel support. We cannot help with issues from your own customization. We cannot provide customizations that extended default Business Manager features. What you see in demo is what comes with your purchase. We cannot provide how-to advice on if Business Manager is capable of doing what you want\/need. Read documentation and try demo to determine if it will suit your needs. We cannot provide fixes that are unique to your web hosting or server environment. If your hosting or server environment is different than what is listed in requirements section, you'll need to determine if it will work before purchasing. We try for fast response times but as described on our support tab, response time may be up to 2 business days. Too many issue\/feature questions that do not fall under support will slow down all response times. Please investigate for yourself thoroughly before contacting us. Other notes and considerations: If you found a bug feel free to report but first check if there in new version available. Before asking questions, please search the comments area. Questions may have already been answered. Before asking questions, please check the documentation. Before asking questions, please check the FAQ's. If you are experiencing installation problem please open a support ticket. You can be assisted while your server meets the Business Manager requirements. Please do not ask for a free licence. We appreciate help but will not compensate for it. Please dont ask for support on the comments sections. Usualy you will get the answer &quot;Please open a support ticket&quot;. If your support is expired, before asking questions consider renewing it. You cannot get a refund once the item has been downloaded under any circumstances. Regarding freelance or customization: Please do not ask for custom work \u2013 It is not offered or considered. Please do not ask for parnerships \u2013 It is not offered or considered. Can I request a feature? You can always indicate which features you would like to see. We highly appreciate user input. This does not mean that it is technically possible or feasible to build in these feature(s), or that we will build it in within a certain time. We may consider feature requests, but understand that seemingly simple updates can be technically challenging due to design choices made during the development process. Product development is time-consuming. Features may sound easy because they are easy to grasp, but can be complex to implement while keeping everything backwards-compatible. Will you update the script? Of course, we can't make hard promises, but as long as the financial compensation allows, we intend to work on this project, because we believe it is a useful tool that can be extended endlessly. Can I get a discount? We believe that the price should be fair. It's already as low as possible, so discount is not meaningful. Can I get a refund? You cannot get a refund once the item has been downloaded under any circumstances. There is an online demo where you can test all features, and you can ask questions before making the purchase.","tags":"","url":"Frequently_Asked_Questions.html"}]}
